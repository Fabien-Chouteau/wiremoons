### Welcome!

The repositories I have shared on GitHub are in quite a few different compiled languages such as: C, Nim, Go, and Ada. I also have quite a bit of shell script code as I use it to manage my computers, so their setup can be automated easily and efficiently. I write programs as one of my hobbies.

My programs primarily focus on command line tools that provide a utility I wished to have for my own personal use. Nearly all should work on any major operating system, as I tend to use them on and off to differing degrees. My primary OS is Ubuntu, so most code and activities originate on Linux.

I hope you find something useful or interesting ðŸ˜„
